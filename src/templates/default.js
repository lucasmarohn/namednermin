//when querying data for a flexible content block there are a few things to remember. To access flexible content fields, instead of using their field name, you need to use [field_name]_[post_type] (if you have field named page_builder in your WordPress pages you would need to use page_builder_page). Once you do that everything will return in an array in the exact order they are in the ACF block.
export const query = graphql`
  query($id: Int) {
    wordpressPage(wordpress_id: { eq: $id }) {
      title
      wordpress_id
      content
    }
  }
